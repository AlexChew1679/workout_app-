1. Install rspec and capybara

                            group :development, :test do
                              # Call 'byebug' anywhere in the code to stop execution and get a debugger console
                              gem 'byebug', platform: :mri
                              # rspec
                              gem 'rspec-rails'  <= change here
                            end

                            group :test do
                              gem 'capybara'   <=  change here
                            end

        rails g rspec:install
        bundle binstubs rspec-core


        mkdir spec/features
        touch spec/features/creating_homepage_spec.rb


        paste below at rails_helper.rb

        config.backtrace_exclusion_patterns = [
          /\/lib\d*\/ruby\//,
          /bin\//,
          /gems/,
          /spec\/spec_helper\.rb/,
          /lib\/rspec\/(core|expectations|matchers|mocks)/
        ]

2. Setting up Guard
==============

                        Add the following to the development group of the Gemfile:

                        gem 'guard', '~>2.14.0'
                        gem 'guard-rspec', '~> 4.7.2'
                        Run the following commands on the command line:

                        bundle install
                        bundle exec guard init rspec
                        Open the Guardfile and change the following:

                        guard :rspec, cmd: "bundle exec rspec" do
                        to
                        guard :rspec, cmd: "bin/rspec" do
                        Add the following to the rspec block:

                        watch(%r{^app/models/(.+)\.rb$}) { |m| "spec/features/#{m[1]}s" }
                        watch(%r{^app/controllers/(.+)_(controller)\.rb$}) { |m| "spec/features/#{m[1]}" }
                        watch(rails.routes)          { "#{rspec.spec_dir}" }
                        # Put the above code above this line in the Guardfile
                        # Rails config changes

                        Save the file.
    CHECK RSPEC

      $  rspec spec/features/creating_homepage_spec.rb
